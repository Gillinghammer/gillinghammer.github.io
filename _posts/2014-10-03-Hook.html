<p>Hi there, and welcome to my blog. I'm planning to share stories about my new adventure learning to become a web developer. So far I'm 10 weeks into a 12 week <strong>full-stack</strong> <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="_blank">immersive web development bootcamp</a> in <strong>London</strong>. I've learned a ton and am planning to share some of my experiences right here on this blog, so stay tuned!</p>
