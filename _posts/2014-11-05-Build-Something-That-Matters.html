<p>I recently read this great book by TOMS, founder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Mycoskie" target="_blank">Blake Mycoskie</a>. In the book he describes the 'Ah-hah' moment he had when stumbling upon the one-for-one business model he invented. In case you're unfamiliar with TOMS, basically when you buy one pair of their Argentine style shoes, you're also buying a pair for a child who needs them. The shoes are very cool, so <a href="http://www.toms.com" target="_blank">buy your next pair there</a>.</p>
<p>In Blake's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Start-Something-Matters-Blake-Mycoskie/dp/075354024X" target="_blank">'Start Something That Matters'</a>, he explains that companies no longer need to be for profit, or non-for-profit, but instead can be both. By selling a product that also supports a cause at the same time, you receive cheaper marketing opportunities and free publicity. It took one Vanity Fair article to turn TOMS into an over night success. Your product instantly has an edge over similar products, by allowing the customer to feel good about their purchase knowing it supports a cause.</p>
<p>It's time for businesses to transcend the normal types of profit/not-for profit business models as we head deeper into the 21st century. Even more today, we live in a hyper connected world where resources are starting to become scarce. It's now even less acceptable to ignore someone else's problems simply because they live far away. The internet and other media outlets now connect us to these far away locations in real time, our neighbors are now our global neighbors.</p>
<p>Next time, you're thinking of building a new app or product, think about this one-for-one model or other innovative ways to do good while generating revenue. Silicon Valley, has lost its way lately. I think much of this is to do with the huge valuations and billion dollar buyouts we're seeing in the industry. Products like Snapchat, Yo, and other very popular yet simple apps are flooding the marketplace, stealing our attention, but delivering very little social impact.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a>, solving huge problems and creating compelling products at the same time should be praised for their leadership. He is a fantastic example of this new win-win relationship between for-profit companies and their social <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">efforts</span> responsibilities. For your next company or idea, join leaders like Blake and Elon and make it for-profit-for-good.</p>
