title: To Code or Not To Code...
---
<p>This has been a burning question I've had most of my life. I'm happy to answer it now with an authoritative <strong>YES</strong>.</p>
<p>I've always known my future was in tech. However, growing up in a less than high tech part of the Midwest, it was a struggle to figure out how to get myself on that track. I remember taking C++ in high school and being totally turned off to programming, thinking it wasn't for me. However, I knew there were other ways for me to get involved and shortly after university, I landed the job of a lifetime working for a new electric car startup, <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com" target="_blank">Tesla Motors</a>. After filling a technical sales and marketing role at Tesla for 5 years and watching the company swell from 200 to over 6,000 employees, it was time for me to (pardon the pun) recharge my batteries.</p>
<p>I needed to clear my head and figure out the next step on my journey to find success in the tech world. While traveling to amazing places in Europe and South America, I outsourced the development of an app I call <a href="https://hstk.co/">Haystack</a>. I found a great team to bring my <strong>anonymous employee review</strong> web application to life and learned a lot about outsourcing to a remote team in the process. Eventually, after a small test pilot with my former Tesla colleagues I realized more tweaks and product changes were needed in order for my app to catch on. I came to the realization that this site was always going to need work and could soon just become a money pit. Instead I'd finally address the question that has been always present in my head since first booting up Windows 95: To code or not to code? That is the question.</p>
<p>Over the past few years with online resources like Code Academy, I'd taught myself a few languages like Ruby and Python, but always struggled to bring everything together with web frameworks like Rails. I decided to enroll in the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="_blank">General&nbsp;Assembly&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Development&nbsp;Immersive</a> program, which promised to take you from novice to <strong>junior&nbsp;full-stack&nbsp;developer</strong> in 12 furious weeks.</p>
<p>The course moves quite fast and really delivers on its full-stack promise. Within the first 3 weeks we'd covered Ruby and querying databases with sql. Week 4, we worked on our own individual Ruby on Rails web application, that we presented to a panel of judges at the end of the week.</p>
<p>If you've read the <a href="{% post_url 2014-10-05-Chat-App-On-Node %}">previous blog post</a>, you'll see I'm now taking on new challenges outside of the course curriculum and teaching myself other frameworks like Node.js. I'm excited to say that it's all starting to click and I look forward to working as a professional web developer.</p>
