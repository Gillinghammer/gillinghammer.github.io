title: Earful, The Sound Journal
---
<p>Over the past year I've traveled to some amazing places. Like most, I furiously photographed and recorded every amazing sight around me. So much so that snapping photos and recording videos was detracting from my experience in these special locations.</p>
<p>During this time I read an article about a guy that used the 'Voice Memo' app on his phone to record the sounds he was hearing at that location. Whether it was a busy street, or a secluded beach, each location offered a unique sound to remind him of the experience.</p>
<p>I decided to build on this concept by creating a web application to store many of the sound recordings I've taken over the past year. These sounds I've recorded will be tagged with their location, my mood and anything else that was happening at the time. I'll also allow the person to leave journal entries to accompany the sound, which they can share publicly or keep private.</p>
<p>It usually takes me awhile to visualize exactly what the end product will look like, so I typically begin each project with wireframes.</p>

<p>You can start to get a sense for what I am going for by looking at these wireframes. For starters, I am designing this to be a mobile web app. You can see in the first screenshot that the user will see their sounds listed like journal or diary entries. The second shows what the user sees when clicking into one of their entries. Finally, the search page, where users can search for sounds by tags located near their current location, or in the global database of sounds.</p>
<p>Now that I have a more concrete idea of what I am building, I can more easily setup the rails models and associations that will exist in the underlying database.</p>
