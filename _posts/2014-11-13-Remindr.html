title: Remindr - New way to Keep in touch
---
<p>
Just a quick screenshot of the latest project I've begun developing. Remindr, is an app that helps you stay in touch with Friends, Family and Professional contacts. Eventually you'll receive a weekly email summary of those people you need to stay in touch with based on an interval you specify. The app is already taking shape and is functional after just 2 days of work.
The app's stack is Angular on top of Rails and PostgreSQL.

I've also been using <a href="http://bourbon.io" target="_blank">Bourbon.io</a> and <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/" target="_blank">Neat</a> from the great folks at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/" target="_blank">ThoughtBot</a> to move this project along more quickly.
