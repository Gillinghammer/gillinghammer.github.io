title: Learning Node.js
---

<p>My assignment this weekend is to prepare a 30min lesson to give to my fellow classmates about a computer science related topic.</p>
<p>We were allowed to choose any topic that interests us and would be beneficial to the rest of the class. I really enjoy javascript and have been hearing a lot about Node.js recently, so I figured it would be a great topic to cover.</p>

<h3>Node.js, what's it all about?</h3>
<p>Node.js is an event driven javascript based framework designed to build highly scalable and efficient network applications. Node functions only run when needed and can support multiple calls at once. This keeps it lightweight and scalable.</p>
<h3>Why would you want to run JavaScript on the server side?</h3>
<p>JavaScript is perfectly suited for asyncronys tasks. It's also become a ubiquitous programming language understood by most web developers around the world. Node.js was built on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/v8/">V8 Engine</a> developed by Google (Chrome web browser runs on this) which makes it very fast.</p>
<h4>Node Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Real-time communication between the client and server</li>
  <li>Blocking I/O operations are passed as asynchronys tasks</li>
  <li>Easy database reading and writing using JSON data serializers</li>
  <li>HTTP requests are treated like streams which can be processed in real-time</li>
  <li>NPM, Node Package Manager, for installing publicly available reusable components</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, Sinatra-like web development framework</li>
    <li><a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>, HAML-like templating engine and the default for the Express framework</li>
    <li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/coffee-script">Coffee-Script</a>, a coffee script compiler written for Node.js applications</li>
    <li><a href="">Socket.io</a>, allows the server to push data to the client through a persistent connection</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
