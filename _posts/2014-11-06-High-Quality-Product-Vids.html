title: The Age of High Quality Video Promos
---
<p>
Ever since Kickstarter entered the scene we've seen countless examples of amazing promotional product videos. The production value of these videos is off the charts good.

<p>
I just came across a new group messaging service called 'Slack' and their video inspired me to write this short post. Head to <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack.com</a> and watch their slick Slack video. Then tryout their product because I know most offices struggle with internal communications and organization of files.

In my opinion the guys over at <a href="DollarShaveClub.com" target="_blank">DollarShaveClub.com</a> really got this trend of funny high quality videos going when their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI" target="_blank">'Our Blades Are F***ing Great'</a> video went viral on YouTube with over 16 million views.
