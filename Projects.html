<p>GifPlaceholders was an idea I got from other fun sights like <a href="http://placekitten.com/">placekitten.com</a> and <a href="http://www.fillmurray.com/">filmurray.com</a> where web designers can quickly find photos at various dimensions for their web projects. I thought an animated GIF version of this would be fun to create. Simply specify a width, height and a category and within moments you'll be provided with a great GIF to use in your site. This was built completely in Javascript with JQuery and uses the <a href="https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI">GIPHY API</a>.</p>

<p>Feed-Me was a team project that myself and two others spent a week creating. We had to meet a specific minimum viable product which included: adding new RSS feeds, subscribing / unsubscribing, favoriting / archiving posts and keeping the database optimized. Feed-Me was built using ruby on rails as designed with SCSS. The goal was to keep the design minimal to highlight the various content sources.</p>

<p>This was a project to learn how to incorporate 3rd party JavaScript libraries into our apps. This is using SoundManager and some wav files from <strong>Daft Punk</strong>. Kudos to <a href="http://www.najle.com/idaft/" target="_blank">iDaft</a> for the inspiration.</p>
