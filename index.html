      <h2><span>TL;DR</span> <span class="readLink"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i></span><span class="hideLink hidden"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></span></h2>
      <p style="display:none;">I 'hyperlooped' my way into Silicon Valley via Tesla Motors and Elon Musk managing the back-end systems for the sales, marketing and service departments. I even sold a few cars. After five years I headed out on my own and after a failed attempt to outsource an app, I decided to <a href="/2014/10/06/Coding-At-Light-Speed.html">learn to code myself</a>.</p>

      <h2>Electric Avenue <span class="readLink hidden"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i></span><span class="hideLink"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></span></h2>
      <p>My Silicon Valley adventure began in 2008 as the world's economy was imploding. A creative marketing effort and Craiglist helped me catch the attention of <strong>little-known-likely-doomed</strong>, electric sports car company, Tesla Motors. </p>
      <p>For the next five years I'd develop sales best practices, streamline internal operations, deliver sales-metrics to Tesla exec team, setup email marketing automation, even help sell and deliver cars. I joined before the company reached 300 employees and left after growing to 6,000. As one of <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/09/06/elon-musk-at-tesla-youre-choosing-to-be-the-equivalent-of-sp/" target="_blank">Elon&nbsp;Musk's "special forces"</a> it was a humbling and amazing initiation to Silicon Valley.</p>

      <h2>Recharge <span class="readLink hidden"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i></span><span class="hideLink"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></span></h2>
      <p>I left in 2013 as Tesla's notoriety and headcount soared. The next year was spent traveling solo around Europe then group backpacking in Patagonia. Employing help from intermittent wifi, I remotely managed the development of an anonymous feedback app, <a href="#hastack">Haystack</a>.</p>

      <h2>Full Stack <span class="readLink hidden"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i></span><span class="hideLink"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></span></h2>
      <p>August 2014, I moved to London and enrolled in a 12 week intensive web-development boot camp. General Assembly's instructors introduced extremely challenging programming concepts to students eventually encompassing full-stack application development.</p>
      <p>After returning to California from the UK, I found an opportunity as a full-stack developer, with ProLeads.io. As the first employee I was fortunate to work alongside co-founder/senior-developer, Anders Fredriksson. During my time here, ProLeads participated in the 500 Startups Accelerator program. Through 500 I was exposed to lectures and discussions from leaders like Dave Mcclure, Sean Percival, Sean Ellis. Even had the opportunity to support the cofounders during their demo day fundraising event at the Computer History museum in Mountain View, CA. </p>
