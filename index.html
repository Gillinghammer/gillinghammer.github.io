      <h2><span>TL;DR</span> <span class="readLink"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i></span><span class="hideLink hidden"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></span></h2>
      <p style="display:none;">I 'hyperlooped' my way into Silicon Valley via Tesla Motors and Elon Musk managing the back-end systems for the sales, marketing and service departments. I even sold a few cars. After five years I headed out on my own to outsource an app. After finding out a few lessons the hard way, I decided to <a class="blogLink" href="/2014/10/06/Coding-At-Light-Speed.html">learn to code myself</a>.</p>

      <h2>Electric Avenue <span class="readLink hidden"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i></span><span class="hideLink"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></span></h2>
      <p>My Silicon Valley adventure began in 2008 as the world's economy was imploding. A creative marketing effort and Craiglist ad helped me catch the attention of an <strong>unknown-certainly-doomed-electric-car-company</strong>, Tesla&nbsp;Motors. </p>
      <p>For the next five years I'd develop sales best practices, streamline internal operations, deliver sales-metrics to Tesla exec team, setup email marketing automation, even help sell and deliver cars. I joined before the company reached 300 employees and left after growing to 6,000. As one of <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/09/06/elon-musk-at-tesla-youre-choosing-to-be-the-equivalent-of-sp/" target="_blank">Elon&nbsp;Musk's "special forces"</a> it was a humbling and amazing initiation to Silicon Valley.</p>

      <p>I left in 2013 as Tesla's notoriety and headcount soared. The next year was spent traveling solo around Europe then group backpacking in Patagonia. Utilizing intermittent wifi, I remotely managed the development of an anonymous feedback app, <a href="http://hstk.co" target="_blank">Haystack</a>.</p>

      <h2>Full Stack <span class="readLink hidden"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i></span><span class="hideLink"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></span></h2>
      <p>August 2014, I moved to London and enrolled in a <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="blank">12 week intensive web-development boot camp</a>. General Assembly's instructors introduced extremely challenging programming concepts to students eventually encompassing full-stack application development.</p>
      <p>After returning to California from the UK, I found an opportunity as a full-stack developer, with <a href="http://proleads.io" target="_blank">ProLeads.io</a>. As the first employee I worked alongside co-founder & senior-developer, <a href="https://angel.co/anders-fredriksson" target="_blank">Anders Fredriksson</a>. Our team participated in the 500 Startups Accelerator where I engaged in weekly discussions with industry leaders such as; <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/about-dave-mcclure.html" target="_blank">Dave Mcclure</a>, <a href="https://growthhackers.com/member/sean/" target="_blank">Sean Ellis</a> and many more. </p>
