          <h2>Earful, Instagram For Sound</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Server-side, Ruby on Rails</li>
            <li>Client-side, Angular.js</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler" target="_blank">Griddler</a>, convert emails to POST requests</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This was my first big project using Angular on top of Ruby on Rails. I really like this approach. Rails makes it very easy to setup the logic while Angular handles all the user interactions and displaying the information. Using these two frameworks together allows you to build prototypes very quickly. I'm looking forward to working on my next project soon.
          </p>
          <p>I also used the ruby gem, Griddler, from the great team at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/" target="_blank">Thoughtbot</a> on this project. Mobile browsers don't currently support accessing the phone's microphone, so I needed a work around to get my sounds added to the site. Using Griddler, I was able to send my recordings as attachments to my application. It uses the text in the subject line as the title of the post and the email body as the content.</p>

            I decided to build a simple search tool to help me find developer roles in different markets. Learning Node.js was something I wanted to do to improve my skillset, so building this app was a worthwhile experiment.

            <p>
              Anyone with a LIFX smartbulb can run this script to turn their LIFX into a stock ticker. Red for bad days, Green for good and Blue for flat. The 'mactts' gem gives access to your macs' 'say' command, so be prepared for it to read aloud the weather and individual stock information.</p>

              <p>
                Take a look at the very simple main.rb file to update with your location and list of stocks to follow.
